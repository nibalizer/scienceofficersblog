    Over the last several weeks I have made several security related postings. This blog post will look at what topics I covered, and see if any patterns emerge.
    <br>
    One obvious pattern is that I chose to talk about things only in the context of free and open source software. Nothing I talked about in my blog had anything to do with windows, orcale, apple or other proprietary vendors. I also stayed away from software as a service vendors such as google docs and amazon web services. I chose this because this is how I live my life. I will always try to use free software that I control before I will give up control to someone else, or use software that is nonfree.
    <br>
    Most of the material I used for these posts came from seeds in my own experience. Then I went on an exploratory journey, checking and investigating, doing science, then reporting back. Firefox certs came from me having to modify my certificate trust system for work. Ssh analysis came from years of seeing hosts getting bruteforced.
    <br>
    This blog is going to be useful for Unix hackers interested in light security topics. Digging into the internals of firefox's cert store and setting up ssh honeypots are exactly the kind of things that Unix/Linux system administrators work with. They don't do them every day, so they need a refreence, and this blog can be that reference.
    <br>
    For those comming in after me, I'd look deeper into replacing kippo with something custom written, such as a docker tooling system. I'd also create my own Root CA and add that to the firefox trust chain and then see how much fun I can have.
